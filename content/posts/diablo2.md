# 💀 Why Grinding in *Diablo II* Often Isn’t Fun (by the Numbers)

Even though Diablo II is a classic, the way its grind works can make it feel more like punishment than reward. Let’s look at this through hard data and player experience.

## ⚡ 1. The Infinity Problem (Numbers That Break Motivation)

**Infinity** (the god-tier runeword for casters) is almost mandatory for efficient endgame farming.  
But getting it *legitimately*? Let’s break down the math.

### Infinity Recipe
`Ber + Mal + Ber + Ist` in a 4-socket polearm.

The two **Ber runes** are the killer.

### Real Drop Chances (Solo, Hell Difficulty)

| Rune | Approx. Drop Rate (per monster) | Equivalent "one every..." |
|------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Ber  | 1 in 20,000,000 (Hell Cows, p1) | ~20 million kills |
| Mal  | 1 in 2,000,000 | 2 million kills |
| Ist  | 1 in 1,000,000 | 1 million kills |

So the *expected* number of Hell monsters you’d need to kill for **2 × Ber, 1 × Mal, 1 × Ist** is roughly:

> (20M × 2) + 2M + 1M = **43 million monster kills**

Even if you clear **300 monsters per run**, that’s:

> 43,000,000 ÷ 300 ≈ **143,000 runs**

At **5 minutes per run**, that’s about **500 days** of nonstop grinding.

That’s *before* you even get a 4-socket ethereal elite polearm to put it in — which itself might take **hundreds of runs**.

So you can easily sink **hundreds of hours** into the game and still never see the core item that unlocks your build’s potential.

## 🧠 2. RNG Dominates Skill or Strategy

You can be the most efficient player in the world — kill faster, teleport better, hit perfect maps — but the numbers don’t care.  

If your loot table never rolls those high runes, your build stays crippled.  
It’s **RNG > Skill**, which kills long-term motivation.  
You don’t *earn* progress, you *wait* for it.

## 💬 3. You Feel Stuck Between “Need Infinity” and “No Progress”

Because Infinity (and similar items) are *so essential*:
- You can’t run high-resistance mobs efficiently without it.  
- So you end up running the same maps endlessly for drops you’ll statistically **never see**.

That’s when the grind stops being exciting — it becomes math, not adventure.

## 🩸 TL;DR Summary

| Problem | What Happens | Numbers / Example |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Essential Gear Locked Behind RNG** | Need Infinity to progress | 2 × Ber = ~1/20M each |
| **Insane Grind Times** | 143,000 runs for runes | ~500 hours+ |
| **No Skill-Based Progression** | RNG > skill | Drops don’t scale with efficiency |
