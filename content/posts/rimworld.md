Imagine you don't have much time in your real life, so you want to make a fast run.

You want to build the **spaceship the fastest way possible**. You could wait for an event of a ship ready to fly, but that can make the run 5 min longer, and this is not fun.

So you start with the most advanced option: 3 colonists, and you **choose 2 of them very intelligent to progress fast in technology**. You choose mountains with caves in a temperate rainforest and you get a free house (cave) with a short entry to trap every raider.

How RimWorld balances the game is **the raids you get are proportional to your wealth**, so you don't store any wealth you don't need. You don't produce anything in excess to trade: no animals, no sculptures. Plantations, constructions, etc. all that can't be sold, don't count as wealth, so you will get raids of 1 guy with a club.

# Some numbers

These are the techs you need to complete a spaceship:

* Geothermal power **3,200** (for reliable and easy energy production)
* Smithing **700**
* Machining **1,000**
* Microelectronics **3,000**
* Multi-analyzer **4,000**
* Fabrication **4,000**
* Advanced fabrication **4,000**
* Starflight basics **4,000**
* Starflight sensors **4,000**
* Machine persuasion **3,000**
* Vacuum cryptosleep **2,800**
* Starship reactor **6,000**
* Johnson-Tanaka drive **6,000**

Total of **45,700** points of technology.

Imagine you have 2 colonists with max research speed:

- **2 researchers at max level × 1.5 high-tech bench × 3 game speed = 9 research/sec**

That means 45,700 / 9 = 5,078 sec, or 86 min.
Counting that the colonists need to sleep, eat, relax, and do small chores, it's × 2 = **173 min** ONLY WAITING for research.

Of course, this doesn't count the gameplay of starting the colony, getting all the materials for the Multi-analyzer at mid-game, and gathering all the materials for the ship, that's the **shorter fun part**.

But at some point, you will have to wait **at best 3 hours staring at your screen** at full speed doing NOTHING.

**I don't know you, but I don't think doing nothing for 3 hours is fun. Like playing a "pay to skip" game but you can't even pay.**

# How the "game" tricks your brain

The game gives you a **false sensation of good speed progression** by giving you raids equivalent to your wealth. It doesn't matter if you are very slow making things—the raids will be equivalent to your "stage."

(That means **you cannot play relaxed with a horse farm for fun** because horses are expensive, and you will get huge raids for that even if you don't have anything else to defend yourself.)

So in a normal game, you will be improving your base thinking it's a good strategy while waiting for that researcher for hours and hours to finish, and getting harder and harder raids and struggling to 
survive, making the **game look challenging when it really isn't**.
