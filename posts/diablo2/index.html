<h2 id="-1-the-infinity-problem-numbers-that-break-motivation">⚡ 1. The Infinity Problem (Numbers That Break Motivation)</h2>
<p><strong>Infinity</strong> (the god-tier runeword for casters) is almost mandatory for efficient endgame farming.<br>
But getting it <em>legitimately</em>? Let’s break down the math.</p>
<h3 id="infinity-recipe">Infinity Recipe</h3>
<p><code>Ber + Mal + Ber + Ist</code> in a 4-socket polearm.</p>
<p>The two <strong>Ber runes</strong> are the killer.</p>
<h3 id="real-drop-chances-solo-hell-difficulty">Real Drop Chances (Solo, Hell Difficulty)</h3>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Rune</th>
          <th>Approx. Drop Rate (per monster)</th>
          <th>Equivalent &ldquo;one every&hellip;&rdquo;</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Ber</td>
          <td>1 in 20,000,000 (Hell Cows, p1)</td>
          <td>~20 million kills</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Mal</td>
          <td>1 in 2,000,000</td>
          <td>2 million kills</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Ist</td>
          <td>1 in 1,000,000</td>
          <td>1 million kills</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>So the <em>expected</em> number of Hell monsters you’d need to kill for <strong>2 × Ber, 1 × Mal, 1 × Ist</strong> is roughly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(20M × 2) + 2M + 1M = <strong>43 million monster kills</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you clear <strong>300 monsters per run</strong>, that’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>43,000,000 ÷ 300 ≈ <strong>143,000 runs</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At <strong>5 minutes per run</strong>, that’s about <strong>500 days</strong> of nonstop grinding.</p>
<p>That’s <em>before</em> you even get a 4-socket ethereal elite polearm to put it in — which itself might take <strong>hundreds of runs</strong>.</p>
<p>So you can easily sink <strong>hundreds of hours</strong> into the game and still never see the core item that unlocks your build’s potential.</p>

<h2 id="-2-rng-dominates-skill-or-strategy">🧠 2. RNG Dominates Skill or Strategy</h2>
<p>You can be the most efficient player in the world — kill faster, teleport better, hit perfect maps — but the numbers don’t care.</p>
<p>If your loot table never rolls those high runes, your build stays crippled.<br>
It’s <strong>RNG &gt; Skill</strong>, which kills long-term motivation.<br>
You don’t <em>earn</em> progress, you <em>wait</em> for it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-3-you-feel-stuck-between-need-infinity-and-no-progress">💬 3. You Feel Stuck Between “Need Infinity” and “No Progress”</h2>
<p>Because Infinity (and similar items) are <em>so essential</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t run high-resistance mobs efficiently without it.</li>
<li>So you end up running the same maps endlessly for drops you’ll statistically <strong>never see</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s when the grind stops being exciting — it becomes math, not adventure.</p>
